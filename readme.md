# terrorisland
Please enjoy this local mirror and book-version of the webcomic _Terror Island_ of terrorisland.net

This project contains (or will contain), two folders: mirror/, which is a local mirror of terrorisland.net, and book/, which houses versions of a book made from that mirror.

This project, as a whole, is NOT entirely free / libre!!! The webcomic belongs to its authors. Any software or content additionally made for this project is (by the very declaration of this sentence) effectively public domain in all respects EXCEPT that if you modify the book-versions you have to change the name of the edition, and describe your changes; so, for example, if your name is John Smith, and the year is 2025, and you make one of the book-versions blue-tinted for some reason, please change the relevant name of the book-version to, eg, unofficial-johnsmith-2025, and perhaps make your own foreward or addendum to my foreward describing your changes (you can also just describe your changes in a readme, or, in extremis, merely the git history of the project). This constraint does not apply for changes you submit to my repo that I accept.

In the mirror directory there are various things that had to be taken from archived copies on web.archive.org, as the original website holding them has gone down. (See mirror.sh for more details.) I was able to find most things this way, but 218.html references a "Batman-related discover\[y]" at http://www.pizdaus.com/pics/4zKsFnpp34zH.jpg that is lost to time.

# Some of the TODOs I have to iron out:

Should I make a process here like I've done for other projects, that shows me a diff of all the output each change, to check easily for bad refactors?

The project is pretty much perfect, except that a couple pdf links just go to... nothing. And therefore are bad table of contents members. "Check it" is the review, though...

Why is there a `cast*` page now? Did I make a scripting error.

Wait does Z cover back get placed wrong now?!

I should probably archive and include the fancomic that is so lovingly linked to.
https://hawaiianshirts.livejournal.com/46599.html, I think? Which is also in Fan Art & Related Items, but only an excerpt of it.

Strip #90 has a quote smarted after a hyperlink, producing "Here‘s". I may have to report this to calibre itself.

The links in Strip #112 to the old comics aren't mapped to the book, possibly because they are non-www versions of the url.

Should I include the transcripts as an appendix? Hmm. Probably. Or perhaps directly on each page, especially because I'm thinking it's more inevitable that each comic will take up like two pages on average (mode).
