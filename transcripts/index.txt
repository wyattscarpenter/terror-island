    Jame.Jame: Once again, there isn't any Law of Jame. But, I guess
    jaywalking is illegal.Waiterman: If there's no law, why would it be

    [[First Folio and the Unity are standing together with the non-
    magical Cube of Ithakar behind them]]First Folio: Okay, forget the
    cube. Is there any way of getting Aorist back that you'd approve of?
    Blue Unity Member: Approval matters not.Yellow Unity Member: You
    make no sense.First Folio: Is there some way that, um, preserves the
    balance?Red Unity Member: There is one way. You would first need to
    locate his killer.First Folio: The demon's probably still where we
    had the party.Red Unity Member: Next, you must obliterate his host
    body.First Folio: What? How the hey does killing Jame help preserve
    the balance?Blue Unity Member: Imagine that the two halves of the
    universe rest on a giant seesaw.First Folio: OK.Yellow Unity Member:
    We hope that has made everything clear to you.

    the spirit's gone, but the stool itself still talks. She said that
    was probably an unrelated issue.Green Grocer: Strange. What does it
    talk about?Furniture store guy: Hard to tell. It mostly speaks some

    prize grapes.Gunpowder: What? No, there's a lot more to what he did
    than that! Over the next few months -Jame: Can we skip the litany of
    his offenses?Gunpowder: It was going to be more of a montage than a
    litany.Jame: Gunpowder, I really don't have time for all

    obviously going to take its toll on the taxidermy industry.Jame:
    That's a pretty strained use of the word "obviously".Gunpowder: And
    so, seven cobblers agreed to each sail one of the seven seas for
    treasure, which would be buried in a location to be decided later.

    measured in willpower, not physical distance.Helmut: You see, to
    solve this for you would be to injure you. The value of any activity
    is in the struggle.Gunpowder: Do you even have any idea where

    your life? The real stunts couldn't care less about you and your so-
