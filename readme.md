# terror island (wyattscarpenter git repo)
Please enjoy this local mirror and book-version of the webcomic _Terror Island_ of terrorisland.net

This project contains (or will contain), these folders:
* mirror/, a local mirror of terrorisland.net
* transcripts/, a local mirror of transcripts of _Terror Island_
* book/, which houses versions of a book (the "compilations" aka "books") made from those mirrors

book/books/ contains the up-to-date versions of the books

This project, as a whole, is NOT entirely free / libre!!! The webcomic belongs to its authors.

Any software or content additionally made for this project is (by the very declaration of this sentence) effectively public domain in all respects EXCEPT that if you modify the compilations you have to change the name of the edition, and describe your changes; so, for example, if your name is John Smith, and the year is 2025, and you make one of the compilations blue-tinted for some reason, please change the relevant part of the name of the compilation to, eg, unofficial-johnsmith-2025, and perhaps make your own foreword or addendum to my foreword describing your changes (you can also just describe your changes in a readme, or, in extremis, merely the git history of the project). This constraint does not apply for changes you submit to my repo that I accept.

In the mirror directory there are various things that had to be taken from archived copies on web.archive.org, as the original website holding them has gone down. (See mirror.sh for more details.) I was able to find most things this way, but 218.html references a "Batman-related discover\[y]" at http://www.pizdaus.com/pics/4zKsFnpp34zH.jpg that is lost to time.

# Some of the TODOs I have to iron out:

(I may have written TODO inline in a couple places; grep for that)

sus link behavior in #48 of terror island

Should I make a process here like I've done for other projects, that shows me a diff of all the output each change, to check easily for bad refactors?

The project is pretty much perfect, except that a couple pdf links just go to... nothing. And therefore are bad table of contents members. "Check it" is the review, though...

Why is there a `cast*` page now? Did I make a scripting error.

Wait does Z cover back get placed wrong now?!

I should probably archive and include the fancomic that is so lovingly linked to.
https://hawaiianshirts.livejournal.com/46599.html, I think? Which is also in Fan Art & Related Items, but only an excerpt of it.

Strip #90 has a quote smarted after a hyperlink, producing "Here‘s". I may have to report this to calibre itself.

The links in Strip #112 to the old comics aren't mapped to the book, possibly because they are non-www versions of the url.

Should I include the transcripts as an appendix? Hmm. Probably. Or perhaps directly on each page, especially because I'm thinking it's more inevitable that each comic will take up like two pages on average (mode). Either way, this will aid electronic searching in the pdf, and possibly manual searching if it's a compact appendix? And if it's not an appendix, possibly this could be an additional form of commentary (not by me; by anonymous randos). I guess if it's on the same page it will serve to document some character names, which can eventually be important, like in the case of Unfamiliar Checker 2 — um that name isn't actually in the transcripts, huh? Probably was just in the unseen production script for #151 and then later mentioned in dialogue during the metafictional #340.

Ben's notes for Strip #233 seemingly mis-identify Rnbrdu as Lord Terror, which is interesting. Strip #194, the concept art, establishes those respective names and its title text is "If you can figure out some way to count this as canon, go for it.", curious. Rnbrdu is never named (nor seen?) again, but Lord Terror does appear subsequently in the comic several more times with the name and look from #194. I don't think I currently have any way to note this in the text of the book, except maybe as a fun fact in the compiler's foreword.

The ohnorobot transcripts contain several typos, but I think I will just leave those in there, especially because I can't see any way to correct them on ohnorobot itself. (Back when ohnorobot was more like a real website there presumably was such a way.) I should lampshade this like "including their original typos!" although come to think of it their original typos may have been different, for some understanding of "original"; but something along those lines, anyway.

I don't think I have this one yet (try https://web.archive.org/https://chrisyates.net/reprographics/index.php?page=376 later):
> Strip #62 — Friday, November 3, 2006: Did you see our guest strip at Reprographics yesterday? If not, or if you did but it wasn’t very memorable for you, go check it out! Sid and Stephen are kind of in it, but it probably isn’t canonical. https://chrisyates.net/reprographics/index.php?page=376

I've read and enjoyed Ben's previous photocomic, not Request Comics but an earlier one that involved, uh, some stuff, and there was a rock named Ed the Unnameable, and something. I would probably like to archive that as well. Try https://web.archive.org/https://factitious.net/ later, maybe there's a link to it? Or somewhere in request comics? Oh it's in the book, actually. It's FOMS. https://factitious.net/FOMS/current.html (wait a minute, this comic also begins with the characters discussing buying groceries?! What the heck?! Wow?! https://factitious.net/FOMS/060203.html)

I should probably include a copy of goat plague in here as extra material, I suppose. That's also referenced by the fan comic hawaiianshirts.livejournal.com/46599.html. Possibly try seeing if any version on https://web.archive.org/https://hawaiianshirts.livejournal.com/46599.html links to it, for authenticity's sake. It's also available at  https://web.archive.org/https://factitious.net/classic/goatplague.html
